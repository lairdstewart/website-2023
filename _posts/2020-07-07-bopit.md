# Bop It!

I recreated Bop It! with an Arduino, speaker, display, a few sensors, and my new hardware prototyping skills from CS3651: Prototyping Intelligent Devices at Georgia Tech. This was my final project for the course. 

The battery-powered game features 3 actions: bop, twist, and flip. Audio queues and feedback are provided via a speaker and the score is presented on a display after each round. The score is calculated based on how quickly the user can perform each correct action. The components are mounted in a painted, laser-cut box.
