# Time-Block Planner GUI in JavaFX



 I created this app for my first semester discovery studio at Georgia Tech. I was taking my first real object-oriented programming course at that time and wanted to apply my new experience. I set out to learn more about the product design process, from user experience to engineering considerations and finally development.

This app provides a simple platform for time-block planning. It mimics my paper planning technique with an empty area on the left for tasks and notes and a calendar broken into 15-minute chunks on the right. 

I built this application with JavaFX. During development I practiced basic object-oriented programming and event driven programming principles. I also utilized advanced principles like lambda expressions and nested classes. Finally, I learned many more advanced JavaFX topics like full press-drag-release operations and applying CSS styling.
