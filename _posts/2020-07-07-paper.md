# SIR Model of Time Dependent Drug and Vaccine Distribution on COVID-19


This manuscript began as an entry to Emory Mathematics Association's 2020 COVID-19 Modeling contest. Our team of four randomly selected Emory undergraduates placed first in the two-month long competition. The faculty member hosting the competition, Dr. Veneziani, suggested we revise and submit the paper to an undergraduate journal. He provided guidance along the way and was our Faculty Sponsor for the submission. 

I developed our model (the system of equations) and wrote a script to simmulate them in Python. I led team meetings, managed schedules and timelines, and coordinated communication between our team and the journal editors. Thanks to Megan, Jesse, and David for their work and Dr. Veneziani for his guidance.
