# 2-Player Chess App in Python

This was my first OOP project in Python. At this point I had just finished my second Java computer science course at Emory and had learned Python in a scientific computing context. 

My goal was to create a fully functioning two player chess game. The game supports all basic functionality including castling, en-passant, check, checkmate, stalemate, and three-move repetition.
