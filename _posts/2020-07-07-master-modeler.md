# Emory X UofSC 2021 Master Modeler Competition


I worked with my friend Joey to analyze ERASE Child Traffickingâ€™s Facebook data and provide insights into their outreach. Over one weekend we built multiple classification algorithms to extract features of successful posts and later presented an executive summary of our findings in a 10-minute presentation. Our work placed first overall in Emory and The University of South Carolina's Business School's joint 2021 Master Modeler Competition.
