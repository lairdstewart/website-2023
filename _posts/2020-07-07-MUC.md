# Toward Optimal Real Time Head Worn Display Captioning Width

As part of the course CS 4605: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing, I had the opportunity to work with Georgia Techâ€™s [Contextual Computing Group (CCG)](https://gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/contextual-computing-group) to research captioning on head-worn displays. Throughout the semester, my group improved the CCGs head-worn display captioning simulator and researched the optimal width of captions within the visual field.
